## Project Documentation

### Overview

This project is a small assignment developed as part of the internship application for Hexleap. The goal was to create reusable and modular components using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. The main focus was on building a reusable Card component that can render different types of cards based on the variant and data passed as props.

### Components

#### Card Component

The Card component is designed to be highly reusable and modular. It accepts props for variant (event, collection, advertisement) and data to render different types of cards.

##### Variants

1. **Event Card**: Displays information about sports events.
2. **Collection Card**: Highlights collection spotlight with team details and event information.
3. **Advertisement Card**: Shows advertisement content with an image, title, and description.
